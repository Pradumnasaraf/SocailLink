## 🚀 Using and deploying the project

After forking the project. Add your links with the endpoints in the [`config/links.json`](/config/links.json) file. You can add your custom endpoints as many as you want.

```json
{
  "github": "https://github.com/Pradumnasaraf",
  "linkedin": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/pradumnasaraf",
  "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/pradumnasaraf.dev",
  "hashnode": "https://blog.pradumnasaraf.dev",
  "twitter": "https://twitter.com/pradumna_saraf",
  "instagram": "https://www.instagram.com/pradumnasaraf"
}
```

That's it. You are ready to deploy the project. You can deploy it using the button below.
